# Metal-Attack-RPG
Play as your favorite Metal Musician. Attack your friends.

Play as one of four Thrash Metal Icons: Tom Araya, Alex Skolnick, Scott Ian, or Dave Mustaine. Each player starts with different values for Attack Points, Health Points, and Counter Attack Points.

Object: Win by vanquishing all remaining enemies in succession.

To begin, choose your player and your first opponent. Use the 'attack' button to attack your opponent. Each attack will decrease your opponent's Health Points and trigger your opponent's counter attack. Your opponent's counter attack will, in turn, decrease your health points. If your character is the victor, choose your next opponent.

The game continues until all opponents are defeated your Health Points are depleted.
